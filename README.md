APPROACH:                                                     
     => The model is based on converting a youtube video into a text summary/transcript.                                           
     => Input is a  youtube video url of a panel discussion.                                                     
     => Output is a textual summary of the discussion.
     => This is obtained by Hugging Face transformers.                                                                                              
     => Transformer is a new architecture that aims to solve tasks sequence-to-sequence while easily handling long-distance dependencies.                  
     => Their core mode of operation for natural language processing revolves around the use of Transformers.                                        
     
     
HOW TO RUN CODE:                                                                                                        
     1.  Install transformers                                                                                                                  
     2.  Install youtube_transcript_api (This is a python API which allows you to get the transcript / summary for a given YouTube video).                   
     3.  Import pipelines form transformers and youtubeTranscriptApi from  youtube_transcript_api.                                              
     4.  Provide the youtube ULR link of required video that need to be transcripted.                                                          
     5.  The regular expression will extract the video ID from any YouTube URL and it works with shortened URLs.                                               
     6.  Undergoing spliting the youtube video url.                                                                                        
     7.  To display video being converted, import YouTubeVideo  from IPython.display and specify the id.                                                            8.  Transcript splitted in stated based on duration.                                                                        
     9.  Join the transcript and dispaly the result and length of characters in the string.                                             
     10. Print the summarized text by converting to a string.                                                                     
     
HOW TO TEST:
     Input a URL of a panel discussion youtube video thet need to be transcripted in the code. Run the code in an python supported environment with all the required libraries. The output is the transcript / text summary.                                                                
     
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESULT:                                                                                                 
     Quantitative: The input is given in a format of youtube url and that provide output as a text format within some limited words. The output is a short description about what the topic is been discussed for the less time consumption of users instead of watching full video for one to two hours.                
     Qualitative: The video that contains of n number of word length is limited to a sort summary to know about what the topic is been discussed. This contains of a good crisp data stating main detials about what is the topic, county, who talks about the topic and important keypoints of context.                  
     
RESULT ANALYSIS:                                                                                                                 
      The output is provided as a text summary format of a URL video link of youtube. The model based on Transformer which is a deep learning model focus in NLP (natural language processing). The provide result in short duration of time . The length is to a limited size of characters that provide accuate result. The output has a good accuracy and the video does not have limit for duration. Length of video is directly proportional to the time to process the transcript. According to the Url provided time feature of the video is 30-35 minutes and the time taken to process the output is nearly 3 to 4 minutes.
      
SAMPLE OUTPUT :                                                                                                                                               
     INPUT : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTco_1xI6SQ                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                               
     OUTPUT : [' A study show one in three fish caught for human consumption contains microplastics . The panel will talk about plastics and basura and how to get rid of them . The next panel will be talking about plastics guys Panama he was and Panama reduce and how can we better live with it alright .', ' Panel includes Monique obligation from buhay zero-waste and joy mosaic akahl from coca-cola Philippines . Dr. Fabian Toby Darian the vice president of the National Academy of Science and Technology and melody Mello Reich from worldwide find Phil fun Philippines Worl .', " WWF says plastic pollution is one of the most annoying things written about living in Metro Manila because it's an eyesore . The Philippines is only Filipinos are the only language that has plastic in our everyday usage the by when you say plastic man Toronto though I we wonder getting Baha co-op back with us and commenting use of plastic that we have that in our language we use it every day .", ' The Philippines is the third largest contributor of garbage in our oceans imagine little Philippines contributes the third biggest amount so what is it about a Filipino culture or our society that makes us so wasteful? The problem is that all of us like all upstanding citizens in the world throw trash in trash in the proper place .', " The Philippines is the third largest generator of waste in the Philippines . It's not throwing your waste improperly it's that we have waste to throw in the first place . A huge percentage of waste that we properly throw actually winds up in the ocean . Filipinos are a very typhoon ridden archipelago so there's always access to waterways .", " The reason why we have a lot of plastics is for the convenience part of the plastic part . The purchasing power of the Filipinos is the reason for the plastics . The problem is not properly throwing waste when we're all actually contributing to this problem because we perpetuate that belief that you know for as long as I'm throwing it in the trash can I'm okay .", " Plastic waste management is governed by the ecological Solid Waste Management Act 9 0 0 3 which was promulgated in the year 2000 now the course of plastic problem is has exploded since then . A lot of the responsibilities given to the barangay and then City but then they're not really equipped to handle plastic so we've given this responsibility to them .", " We have to reimagine plastic as a value chain which includes the management of the waste and the waste has to find some commercial value otherwise it's just going to be dumped now . I don't think all sure actually it's part of Philippine culture I'm sorry sorry store I is a thingy store . The sari-sari store is really ingrained in small communities becoming a contemporary or mono mahira without the inner sari sari store .", " The recycling of plastic is actually a technical problem it's very I don't have time to talk about you know the different types of plastics there may be thirty kinds of plastics and the only thing we're familiar with are the pet bottles HDPE there are many more plastics and so we need a lot more technology .", " Plastic plastic plastic there I don't want to call it a waste because there's no ways I will do believe that waste is just a displaced resource you know it's a resource that we can use again and again over and over again . tight seal to avoid leakage in the environment thus solving the ocean plastic issue and all of the micro plastics being discussed earlier .", " There are eight point three billion tons of plastic ever produced in the world all of that's still out in the environment . Only nine percent or less than nine percent of that has ever been recycled . Even if you recycle plastic it's finite there are only a certain number of times you can actually recycle plastic and those times are like very very few like one to three times .", " Many of us and the second is consumption it's not just about we have to stop thinking about just you know the product getting to us and then like oh how do we dispose of this we also have to we we don't just think downstream of our disposals . We have to think upstream of our purchases so for as long as I'm buying something in plastic whether that gets recycled or whatever happens to it after even if whatever what happens to is good it will still eventually turn into something well into a pollutant .", " WWF Philippines have our Global Initiative what we call no plastics in nature by 2030 . The initiative does not ask everyone to eliminate plastics but rather we prevent it from not entering the ecosystem because let's face real talk knocks happening your mecha Nina no real talk long tire now young plastics inevitable .", ' The world has been using 1.7 planets now and considering that we are own we only have one meaning we are already borrowing resources for our future from our future generations . The first thing that you have to do as citizens as Filipinos would be to reuse to refuse the use of single-use plastics .', " micro plastics have probably been there for the past 50 years I mean answer Nikita a singing antique none and then after my capacity of nano plastics you know that they all eventually break down now I think it's not possible for us to take back all the Nano plastics and micro plastics .", " There's so many additives that are put into the plastics you know the plasticizers the anti flame-retardants additives it's prevented from degrading in the Sun . All of these things add to the toxicity of plastics when they're disposed of so while we have to address the problem of you know consumerism we must produce better plastics .", ' coca-cola Philippines all of our packaging are 100% recyclable from plastic glass aluminum that we use is 100% recycled . By year twenty three thirty our ambitious goal is to collect every single packaging that we put out there so how we will do that by investing in the recycling industry we will we actually announced a 1 billion peso investment on PEP recycling .', ' Kohala has 117 billion bottles globally . The objective is to collect all of that and equivalent all of the bottles . The only way that I see really closing the loop of a PEP bottle is from PEP you use it and it turns again into a pity bottle used for the same beverage .', " We are buhay zero waste we have more than 44,000 members in our community online and growing and hopefully after tonight today there are more members of the community online . We hope after tonight tonight there are \xa0there are  there are .    but they're also but I made the bait then that when you say redesign there's even a more radical notion like I'm sure I'm not sure if you you guys have heard of markets or groceries wherein bow another like a magdalena like a . a market where you have to bring your own your own bottle your own glass bottle .", " For us there actually are five R's not the three that are taught in school or in wherever . There's refused first there's reduced there's reuse there's recycle and rot and there's rot . For us it's not about redesigning packaging or you know for us it is buying things package free it's refusing the things that we don't mean .", " Don't want waste rule number one don't take it you know take it don't bring it home . The second-hand market becomes bigger and the items that we don't need other people might need that will prevent them from buying new things if they get your items instead . Don't buy new things that take resources fuel energy to produce .", " It really depends on the people the people have to buy into it and here I'm talking about the common people from Palenque deeply in stock karamaneh plastic in my baby didn't soft drink in elegance of plastic and if you I mean it's that lifestyle you have to address it's not the lifestyle of the rich I'm worried about is I think the rich can adjust .", " Youth should be advocating for social enterprises that cater to that kind of environment that consumers would eventually go to that you know - that way - to have their own containers and just use dispensers I think it will work for now but definitely if if if the industries can also participate on that it will r. g our own refillables but I don't know where to sink it through how will the poor people adjust design life style do this .", " It's not only the consumers but it's also the industry of course we have the governments to back it up all yeah agree agree agree on that I mean it should be a multi sectoral and the private sector as the manufacturer bla have a very important role in there .", " More than 50% of our packaging up until now and then there's plastic there's aluminum and aluminum and sir I agree with this courage you can drink Coca Cola in the bottle don't transfer it anymore in a single-use plastic and straw please don't you can get it from the fridge cold drink up straight .", ' Le sector or section top talked about all of the solutions and it it requires a multiple and multifaceted approach so with that thank you so much toward speakers we wish we could have more time to discuss this extremely pressing problem . Please join in the efforts of our speakers to reduce our waste and to live more environmentally friendly lives [Applause]']
